##### What is KSPNameGen?
KSPNameGen is a free (both gratis and libre) random name generator for the
popular PC game Kerbal Space Program.

##### Using KSPNameGen
Double click/tap `start.bat` (Windows) or `start.sh` (macOS/Linux), and the
program should start automatically.

Since KSPNameGen is a command-line application, in a command-line environment,
the program can be invoked by `cd`ing to the directory, and typing `start.bat`
(Windows) or `./start.sh` (macOS/Linux).

Note that for macOS/Linux users, you may need to execute `chmod +x ./start.sh`
prior to running (in both GUI and CLI instances), as the execute permission has
not been set.
